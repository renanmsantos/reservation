# Task 05 â€“ Observability & Post-Launch Enhancements (DONE)

## Objective
Add lightweight monitoring, analytics, and roadmap features that support ongoing optimization without increasing infra cost, including visibility into duplicate-name attempts.

## Deliverables
- Integration with Vercel Analytics or Plausible to track seat utilization, conversion funnel, and rate of duplicate-name rejections.
- Scheduled Supabase function exporting daily utilization summary to a shared Google Sheet or email digest, highlighting blocked attempts and override usage.
- Alerting for Supabase errors/latency spikes using free-tier tools (Vercel checks or Healthchecks.io).
- Backlog grooming doc outlining next-phase improvements (notifications, payment, capacity forecasting, richer identity verification).
- Retrospective notes capturing lessons from MVP launch, especially regarding single-reservation enforcement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard or report accessible to organizers summarizing daily/weekly metrics, including duplicate enforcement stats.
- Alerts configured and tested with simulated failure (document trigger method and results).
- No paid services required; monthly cost remains $0 on free tiers.
- Roadmap doc linked from `README` with prioritized backlog items.
- Retrospective shared in `docs/` and acknowledged by team in stand-up notes, including follow-ups about duplicate handling.
