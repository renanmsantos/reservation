# Post-Launch Roadmap

| Priority | Initiative | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | **Automated notifications** | Email/SMS updates when riders move off the waitlist; integrate with Supabase Triggers + Resend/Twilio. |
| P0 | **Admin audit UX** | Promote audit log into richer filters/search, add per-van breakdown, and expose override history. |
| P1 | **Capacity forecasting** | Use historical reservation data to project demand; surface recommended van counts per route. |
| P1 | **Payment holds** | Allow organizers to require a refundable deposit using Stripe Checkout; ensure duplicate-name logic still applies. |
| P1 | **Identity verification** | Optional selfie/license upload for high-value rides; tie verification status into override approval workflow. |
| P2 | **Self-service rider portal** | Let riders release/rebook from mobile, update contact info, and opt into notifications. |
| P2 | **Admin mobile app** | Lightweight PWA for on-site staff to check riders in and manage overrides offline. |
| Backlog | **Analytics deep-dive** | Segment duplicate attempts by device, time of day, and marketing source using Plausible custom properties. |
